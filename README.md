under development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a smartphone-based AI chat application currently under development, utilizing the RPC functionality of Oasis, an AI assistant I’m building for OpenWrt.
> Please note that Oasis-related applications and features are part of an experimental initiative to control IoT devices—such as WiFi routers—using AI (LLMs).
> As such, the system is not yet suitable for everyday use by end users. It remains an experimental platform.
