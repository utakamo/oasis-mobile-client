This is a smartphone-based AI chat application currently under development, utilizing the RPC functionality of Oasis, an AI assistant I’m building for OpenWrt.
Please note that Oasis-related applications and features are part of an experimental initiative to control IoT devices—such as WiFi routers—using AI (LLMs).
As such, the system is not yet suitable for everyday use by end users. It remains an experimental platform.
